RedditSaveButtonBot
===================

A reddit bot that replies to comments like '.' and 'saved' with a reminder that Reddit has a save button.

Written using Python 2.7 and PRAW with a couple of drawbacks (e.g. no SSL for authentication) to enable it to run on PythonAnywhere's free tier. 
That said, it should run in pretty much every environment (Windows box, any VPS with Python installed, etc.), given the proper access, and PRAW installed either manually or via pip.
